# Changelog

## 0.5.1

- Bundle is now transpiled to browserslist's `defaults` for compatibility.

## 0.5.0

### Features

- Smooth interpolation for parametric functions: the parametric function sampling algorithm now dynamically increases the number of samples depending on the roughness of a function. See [PR #37](https://github.com/stevenpetryk/mafs/pull/37).

## 0.4.4

### Bug fixes

- Fixes an issue where, given certain `constrain` functions in `useMovablePoint`, using the keyboard to move points didn't work (see PR #23). Also, keyboard movement was generally broken in certain cases.

## 0.4.3

### Bug fixes

- Axis labels looked odd in Firefoxâ€”they were misaligned. Internally, switching from `alignmentBaseline` to `dominantBaseline` fixed this.

## 0.4.2

### Bug fixes

- Not really a "bug", but Mafs incorrectly declared too strict of a dependency on React 16.8, causing a peerdependency warning when using React 17.

### Improvements

- Mafs no longer has a runtime dependency on gl-matrix-invert, gl-mat2, gl-mat3, or gl-mat4.

## 0.4.1

### Bug fixes

- The TypeScript types for `VectorField` no longer (erroneously) require the `xyOpacity` and `opacityStep` props.

## 0.4.0

### New features

- Added [`Line.Segment`](https://mafs.dev/guides/display/lines/)
- Added [Bezier curve example](https://mafs.dev/guides/examples/bezier-curves/)

### Bug fixes

- `FunctionGraph.Parametric` now supports decreasing values of `t`, enabling functions to be evaluated "backwards".

### Changes

- Dashed lines are now dashier (the dash array was changed from `4,3` to `1,10`).

## 0.3.2

- Re-released as bundled by esbuild. Slightly smaller bundle with minified CSS. No behavioral changes.

## 0.3.1

- Re-released under MIT license. No code changes.

## 0.3.0

Improved the build process to roll up TypeScript types using api-extractor. No
changes have been made to any APIs, but the exported types should more closely
match what is actually exported.
