## Development

Most development is done using the documentation site—live reload makes it easy to see changes made to the library live on the site. Just set up both the root folder and the `docs/` folder.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

In another terminal (wait a few seconds for `yarn start` to spin up before running this):

```
yarn docs:start
```

## Tests

This library has no tests, but they're planned.
